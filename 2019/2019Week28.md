## Tip：
**childViewControllerForStatusBarStyle**
> Called when the system needs the view controller to use for determining status bar style.

If your container view controller derives its status bar style from one of its child view controllers, implement this method and return that child view controller. If you return nil or do not override this method, the status bar style for self is used. If the return value from this method changes, call the `setNeedsStatusBarAppearanceUpdate` method.

`nit` means, a small change that may not be very important, but is technically correct.
