If you want the message to be dequeued when the run loop is in a mode other than the default mode, use the `perform(_:with:afterDelay:inModes:)` method instead. If you are not sure whether the current thread is the main thread, you can use the `performSelector(onMainThread:with:waitUntilDone:)` or `performSelector(onMainThread:with:waitUntilDone:modes:)` method to guarantee that your selector executes on the main thread. To cancel a queued message, use the c`ancelPreviousPerformRequests(withTarget:)` or `cancelPreviousPerformRequests(withTarget:selector:object:)` method.
